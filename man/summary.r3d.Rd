\title{Summarize an r3d Object}
\usage{
\method{summary}{r3d}(object, samples = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{r3d} object produced by \code{\link{r3d}}.}

\item{samples}{A numeric vector of quantile cut-points at which to display aggregated
effects. Defaults to \code{c(0.25,0.5,0.75)}. Used only for convenient partial summaries.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not used).}
}
\value{
The \code{object} is returned invisibly. This function is primarily for printing.
}
\description{
Displays a summary of the local polynomial (or Fr√©chet) regression discontinuity model
fitted by \code{\link{r3d}}. Includes basic information about the method, polynomial order,
fuzzy vs. sharp design, sample size, bandwidth choice(s), and a numeric summary of
the estimated distributional treatment effect \eqn{\tau(q)}.
If bootstrap inference was performed, also reports uniform confidence bands
and test results.
}
\details{
By default, prints:
\itemize{
\item The call used to create the \code{r3d} object,
\item Basic setup and bandwidth details,
\item A table of \eqn{\tau(q)} for all quantiles in \code{object$q_grid},
\item If available, uniform confidence bands and test statistics from the bootstrap,
\item Optionally, average effects on sub-ranges of \eqn{q}.
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
  fit <- r3d(X, Y_list, boot=TRUE)
  summary(fit, samples=c(0.25, 0.75))
